The book description is:
Capitalism is far more (and better) than just an economic system: itâ€™s a durable social system with pillars anchored in philosophy, psychology, politics, and economics. In this pocket guide, Richard Salsman Ph.D. -- Atlas Society Senior Scholar and Professor of Political Economy at Duke University -- explains that capitalism is sustainable because practical, practical because moral, and moral because egoistic. Foes of capitalism no longer deny its power to generate broad prosperity; at root, they oppose it for its objectivity and morality.
