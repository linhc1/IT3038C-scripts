# Project 3

======

This is my inmproved and enhanced calculator based on Project 1. In addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of Project 1, the calculation methods of factorial, square and remainder are added. At the same time, this calculator does not need to input one by one like Project 1, and can directly input the entire formula to calculate the result.

Calculator, as one of our most common tools, cab help me in many ways, so I hope to improve it on the basis of Project 1.

Next is the operation steps

First oprn the virtual environment using powershell and enter

```Powershell
pip install sympy
```

After running, you can start the calculation directly. For example, if you want to calculate the remainder after dividing 11 by 6, you only need to enter

```Powershell
11%6
```

to get the result.
